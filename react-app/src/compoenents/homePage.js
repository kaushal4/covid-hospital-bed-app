            The symptoms data was gathered from various private, government sources, journals like journal of infection, National Center for Biotechnology Information etc. The dataset set was randomly split as test and training set and the model was trained using the training set while the test set was kept aside. The test set was used to calculate the accuracy and our model showed 96% accuracy.

            All you need to do is enter the symptoms you are having that closely relate to the symptoms that are prevalent in many victims of the pandemic. Using the test results, we will suggest you to go to the hospital for a referral or not. The information about availability of beds and oxygen supply in your locality has been retrieved from the official website of Delhi Heath Department to give you accurate real-time updates. We are using an elegant approach to scrap this data!!
